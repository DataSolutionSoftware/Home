## Integration Tasks

- API Development: Creating backend APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that define the protocols, data formats, and operations required for communication between different systems. This involves designing and implementing RESTful APIs, SOAP APIs, GraphQL APIs, or other types of APIs based on the integration requirements.

- Data Transformation and Mapping: Converting data formats, structures, and representations to ensure compatibility between different systems. This may involve transforming data from one schema to another, mapping fields between systems, or performing data validation and cleansing. ORMs are versatile as middlewares in ETL tasks.

- Message Queuing and Event-Driven Integration: Implementing messaging systems and event-driven architectures to enable asynchronous communication and decoupling between components. This involves setting up message queues, event brokers, or publish-subscribe mechanisms to handle communication between systems.

- Security and Authentication: Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access and data protection during integration. This may involve implementing OAuth, token-based authentication (JWT), or other security measures to authenticate and authorize requests - using SSL, Firewalls.

- Error Handling and Logging: Implementing error handling mechanisms to capture and handle exceptions, failures, and unexpected events during integration. This includes logging errors, generating error reports, and implementing retry mechanisms to handle transient failures.

- CI/CD and Integration Testing: Designing and conducting integration tests to ensure the seamless functioning and interoperability of integrated components. This involves testing data exchange, communication protocols, error handling, and overall system behavior.

- Monitoring and Performance Optimization: Setting up monitoring systems to track the performance, availability, and health of the integrated system. This includes monitoring API response times, identifying performance bottlenecks, and optimizing system performance through caching, load balancing, or other techniques.

## Data Structures 

Distributed architecture systems  involves multiple independent services working together. 

Challenges  associated working with such integrated disparate systems  include schema evolution, message  delivery and managing and maintaining consistency of data processing during failures. 

The choice of data structures plays a critical role in facilitating data storage, processing, communication, and state management. Below are key types of data structures you might encounter and examples of how they can be processed.



###  Core Types of Data Structures

- Key-Value Pairs

Use Case: Ideal for caching or storing session data, configuration settings, or any data that can be accessed with a unique key.

Example:

Tools: Redis, DynamoDB.
Scenario: Caching frequently accessed flight search results.

Processing: Retrieve and update values based on keys efficiently (O(1) operations).


- JSON / BSON Documents

Use Case: Used for unstructured or semi-structured data in document stores.

Example:

Tools: MongoDB, CouchDB.

Scenario: Storing user travel preferences or booking details.

Processing: Query and modify specific fields in the document, such as retrieving all bookings for a user.


- Relational Tables

Use Case: For structured data requiring relationships between entities.

Example:
Tools: PostgreSQL, MySQL.
Scenario: Managing user accounts, bookings, and payments.

Processing: Perform SQL operations like SELECT, JOIN, and GROUP BY to fetch or aggregate data.


 - Graphs

Use Case: For relationships and connections between entities.

Example:

Tools: Neo4j, ArangoDB.

Scenario: Representing and querying travel routes or user connections.

Processing: Use graph traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) for recommendations or shortest path discovery.


- Queues

Use Case: For message passing and asynchronous processing.

Example:

Tools: RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS, Kafka.

Scenario: Processing price alerts or booking notifications.

Processing: Messages are enqueued by producers and dequeued by consumers for further handling.


- Logs

Use Case: For sequential, append-only data.

Example:

Tools: Kafka, Elasticsearch.

Scenario: Capturing user activity logs or transaction histories.

Processing: Use batch processing or streaming frameworks (e.g., Apache Flink, Spark) to analyze logs in real-time.


- Distributed Hash Tables

Use Case: For distributed storage of key-value data across nodes.

Example:

Tools: Cassandra, DynamoDB.

Scenario: Handling distributed storage of travel deals or search indexes.

Processing: Partition and replicate data across nodes using consistent hashing.




- Blob Storage

Use Case: For storing unstructured data like images, PDFs, or videos.

Example:

Tools: Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage.

Scenario: Storing user-uploaded passport images or itineraries.

Processing: Retrieve, update, or delete blobs as needed.

## Processing Data Structures 

- Data Storage: Use appropriate databases (SQL for structured data, NoSQL for unstructured data).
Apply indexing for efficient query execution.

- Data Caching:
Use in-memory key-value stores like Redis to reduce database load and improve response times.


- Data Streaming:
Leverage message brokers like Kafka to process data streams asynchronously for real-time insights.

- State Management:
Use distributed hash tables or external session stores for scaling state across services.

- Data Analytics:
Batch processing: Use tools like Apache Hadoop or Spark for historical data processing.


- Real-time analytics: Use tools like Apache Flink or Storm to process logs or queues.

  
- Communication Between Services:
REST APIs or gRPC for synchronous communication.

- Queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous communication to ensure reliability.
