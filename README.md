### DIGITAL TWIN

https://digital-twin-v2-chi.vercel.app/

A virtual representation of a physical Energy Meter Reader.The software mirrors the real-world physical entity by continuously collecting and emitting data at run-time from sensors, IoT devices, and other sources. It leverages advanced emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive maintenance and analytics, and simulates various scenarios and predict future outcomes. Digital twins are adaptable for use and can be simulated for use in all aspects of industry. Namely, digital transformation, eCommerce, defence, aerospace, combat systems, manufacturing, electronics, automotives, utilities and many more.
 
Used in combat systems, digital twins integrates advanced data analytics, real-time simulation, and AI to create a virtual representation of defence assets, systems, and operations, allowing for enhanced decision-making, predictive maintenance, and operational efficiency. By leveraging this technology, it optimises asset management, improve system reliability, and strengthen mission readiness while minimising costs and risks in complex defence environments.

## Our Integration Patterns 

- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA):
  This focuses on production detection, consumption and reaction of Events. Systems  communicate through events, allowing  for decoupled and scalable architectures.

Technologies: Apache Kafka, AWS Event Bridge and NATS Streaming.

- Microservices Integration:
  This architecture involves breaking  down  applications  into small independently deployable  components and services. Integration  Patterns for Microservices include API Gateways, Service  Meshes and Event-driven communication.

Technologies: Istio (Service Nesh), Linkerd, Envoy Proxy.

- GraphQL  for API Integration:
  GraphQL  is a query  language  for APis that allows clients to request data they only  need. It simplifies API Integration  by providing  flexible  and efficient  way to interact  with data.

Technologies: Apollo Server, HASURA, and GraphQL  subscriptions.

- Severless Integration:
  Our Severless computing  infrastructure  allows developers  to build and run applications  without  managing  server  infrastructure. It is often  used for event-driven and small focused functions.

Technologies: AWS Lambda, AZURE    Functions, Google Cloud Functions.

- API Management & Gateway  Solutions:
  Used to optimise, manage and secure API calls. They  also play  key roles in  access  controls, monitoring  and ensuring the performance of API calls.

Technologies: Kong, Ambassador, and Traefik.
