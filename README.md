## Our Integration Patterns 

- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA):
  This focuses on production detection, consumption and reaction of Events. Systems  communicate through events, allowing  for decoupled and scalable architectures.

Technologies: Apache Kafka, AWS Event Bridge and NATS Streaming.

- Microservices Integration:
  This architecture involves breaking  down  applications  into small independently deployable  components and services. Integration  Patterns for Microservices include API Gateways, Service  Meshes and Event-driven communication.

Technologies: Istio (Service Mesh), Linkerd, Envoy Proxy.

- GraphQL  for API Integration:
  GraphQL  is a query  language  for APis that allows clients to request data they only  need. It simplifies API Integration  by providing  flexible  and efficient  way to interact  with data.

Technologies: Apollo Server, HASURA, and GraphQL  subscriptions.

- Severless Integration:
  Our Severless computing  infrastructure  allows developers  to build and run applications  without  managing  server  infrastructure. It is often  used for event-driven and small focused functions.

Technologies: AWS Lambda, AZURE    Functions, Google Cloud Functions.

- API Management & Gateway  Solutions:
  Used to optimise, manage and secure API calls. They  also play  key roles in  access  controls, monitoring  and ensuring the performance of API calls.

Technologies: Kong, Ambassador, and Traefik.

- Cloud Native Integration:

- AI & ML Integration:

- Low Code / No Code Integration:

- Blockchain Integration:

- Data Integration Platforms:

- Edge Computing  Integration:

## Integration Tasks

- API Development: Creating backend APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that define the protocols, data formats, and operations required for communication between different systems. This involves designing and implementing RESTful APIs, SOAP APIs, GraphQL APIs, or other types of APIs based on the integration requirements.

- Data Transformation and Mapping: Converting data formats, structures, and representations to ensure compatibility between different systems. This may involve transforming data from one schema to another, mapping fields between systems, or performing data validation and cleansing. ORMs are versatile as middlewares in ETL tasks.

- Message Queuing and Event-Driven Integration: Implementing messaging systems and event-driven architectures to enable asynchronous communication and decoupling between components. This involves setting up message queues, event brokers, or publish-subscribe mechanisms to handle communication between systems.

- Security and Authentication: Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access and data protection during integration. This may involve implementing OAuth, token-based authentication (JWT), or other security measures to authenticate and authorize requests - using SSL, Firewalls.

- Error Handling and Logging: Implementing error handling mechanisms to capture and handle exceptions, failures, and unexpected events during integration. This includes logging errors, generating error reports, and implementing retry mechanisms to handle transient failures.

- CI/CD and Integration Testing: Designing and conducting integration tests to ensure the seamless functioning and interoperability of integrated components. This involves testing data exchange, communication protocols, error handling, and overall system behavior.

- Monitoring and Performance Optimization: Setting up monitoring systems to track the performance, availability, and health of the integrated system. This includes monitoring API response times, identifying performance bottlenecks, and optimizing system performance through caching, load balancing, or other techniques.

## Systems Design 


This low-level architecture delves into the specifics of each component, detailing interactions, data flow, and technology choices.

### API Gateway:

- Responsibilities:
Routing requests to appropriate services.

Load balancing incoming traffic.

Implementing security measures like SSL termination and request authentication.

Rate limiting to prevent abuse.


- Technology Choices:

Kong: An open-source API gateway with a rich plugin ecosystem.

NGINX: High-performance web server and reverse proxy.

AWS API Gateway: Managed service for creating and managing APIs.
Vertical Services:

### Design:

Each service is a microservice with its own codebase, database, and deployment pipeline.
Services communicate over well-defined interfaces (APIs).

- Technology Choices:
Programming Languages:

Node.js: Suitable for I/O-bound services like Search.

Python: Ideal for data-intensive services like Pricing.

Java: Preferred for transaction-heavy services like Booking.

- Frameworks:

Express.js for Node.js.

Spring Boot for Java.

Django for Python.

### Service Communication:

- Synchronous Communication:

REST: Simple and widely adopted.

gRPC: High-performance, suitable for internal service communication.

- Asynchronous Communication:

Message Queues:

RabbitMQ: Reliable message broker.

Apache Kafka: Suitable for high-throughput, real-time data streaming.

### Data Layer:

- Databases:

Relational Databases:

PostgreSQL: For transactional data like bookings and pricing that need ACID compliance.

MySQL: Optional for horizontal scalability with clustering (e.g., Percona or Galera Cluster).

NoSQL Databases:

MongoDB: For schema-less data, e.g., user-generated reviews and logs.

Cassandra: High availability and linear scalability for distributed data storage.

Search Engine Database:

Elasticsearch: Optimized for text search queries used in the Search service.

Caching Layer:

Redis: Fast in-memory key-value storage for caching frequently accessed data.

Memcached: Lightweight and optimized for fast lookups.

Message Queues:

Apache Kafka: Distributed streaming for event-driven systems, ensuring reliable and scalable communication.

RabbitMQ: For lightweight messaging in services requiring ordered processing.

### Configuration Management:

Consul or etcd: Centralized storage for configurations.

Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets: Manage sensitive and non-sensitive configurations in containerized systems.


### Logging and Monitoring:

Log Aggregation:
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): Logs collection, storage, and visualization.



Fluentd: Unified log processing and forwarding.



Monitoring Tools:


Prometheus: Monitoring metrics and alerts.


Grafana: Data visualization.
Jaeger/Zipkin: Distributed tracing for debugging service interactions.
